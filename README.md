# Cryptography-and-System-Security

Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing". Cryptography is an essential information security tool. It is used in many applications like banking transactions cards, computer passwords, and e- commerce transactions.
